# smoke-segmentation
In the realm of fire safety and disaster management, the evolution of detection techniques has been a continuous endeavor, dating back to as early as 1979 when scholars began proposing methods based on smoke and flame recognition. Over the past decades, attention has primarily been focused on smoke detection, as it can provide earlier clues for fire alarms than flame. Vision-based smoke research primarily encompasses two main categories: smoke detection and smoke segmentation. Visual smoke detection methods (He et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a) typically produce multiple bounding boxes that roughly outline the areas where smoke is present. In contrast, visual segmentation algorithms provide per-pixel precision in classifying smoke, which is crucial for firefighters or robots to swiftly identify fire origins (Yuan et al., 2023). Consequently, smoke segmentation delivers more vital information than smoke detection.
